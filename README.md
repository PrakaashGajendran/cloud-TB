<h2 id="IT infra">Current IT Infrastructure:</h2>

Information technology (IT) is at the heart of every business.  Software, systems and apps let you create reports, manage your accounts, communicate with suppliers and customers, and connect with the outside world through email and the internet.

Even though cloud technology is there to help businesses set up their entire infrastructure online, some companies prefer to set it up themselves. This is especially true for small businesses that don’t need a lot of equipment and don’t have the budget yet to opt for cloud services



<h3 id="IT list">Here is the current IT Setup list:</h3>

<h4 id="Team">* IT Team </h4>

Our company IT teams include Operations, Support. We have around some 1000 people working in the IT department.  
Operations. An operations team oversees a company's operations, technology, and infrastructure.
Support Team refers to the team that provides technical assistance across the organization, such as installing new tools or troubleshooting software and hardware issues.


<h4 id="Cloud">* Cloud computing:</h4>

Cloud computing differs from on-premises software in one critical way. Our company hosts everything in-house in an on-premise environment, when we adopt to cloud environment, a third-party provider hosts all that for us, This allows our companies to pay on an as-needed basis and effectively scale up or down depending on overall usage, user requirements, and the growth of  the  company.

our cloud-based server utilizes virtual technology to host a company’s applications offsite. which lead us for no capital expenses, data can be backed up regularly, and companies only have to pay for the resources, because it allows has to connect with customers, partners, and other businesses anywhere with minimal effort.

Additionally, cloud computing features nearly instant provisioning because everything is already configured. Thus, any new software that is integrated into your environment is ready to use immediately once a company has subscribed. With instant provisioning, any time spent on installation and configuration is eliminated and users are able to access the application right away.

As an example, EDI software has been traditionally been hosted on-premises, but recent cloud computing developments have allowed EDI providers to offer their services via an EDI SaaS model.

This development has saved installation costs for clients, but also enabled software companies to create a recurring revenue model charged on an annual basis.



<h4 id="Hardware">* Hardware</h4>

Even though we use cloud computing, the infrastructure that we have in place uses hardware such as laptops, PCs, wireless routers, and network servers, among other things, to provide a suitable hardware configuration. The acquisition of quality hardware is the first step in putting up an adequate infrastructure. 
Servers/racks -Virtualization determines the number of physical servers. Consider domains, domain controllers, DNS servers, email servers, and more.
Physical storage and backup storage – This includes hard drives , The amount of hard drives are used in our company  on the data we  store, and our storage will grow over time, which means we get more drives eventually other than the cloud storage.

<h4 id="Software">* Software</h4>

Software is necessary for hardware to function properly in an information technology architecture. These days, getting your hands on software isn't too difficult. Our business has chosen to operate in the cloud using a model known as SaaS (Software as a Service) and PaaS(Platform as a Services)  which allows our customers to utilise whatever software they choose on any device.

In light of this, there is no longer a need that you manually install the programme on each device and maintain a separate copy of the software for each device. You just sign up for the services that you want and immediately begin using them. The following is a list of potential software that you may need.

Operating systems, sometimes known as OS, are used for both desktop and server computers.
Software, such as Microsoft Office, that workers need in order to perform their day-to-day responsibilities is an absolute necessity.
Business operations include customer relationship management (CRM), project management, enterprise resource planning (ERP), and a variety of other software that your company will require for its operations.


<h4 id="Network">* Network</h4>

<img src="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/it-information-technology-explained/jcr:content/Grid/category_atl/layout-category-atl/anchor_info.img.png/1631560788551.png" width="200" height="100">

Network allows customers, client and employees to connects the computers and other devices, can get all the computers and devices online easily share files and other data. Here the Employees can get access points and other equipment for the business to run smoothly with help of the Network.
Hosting SaaS software such as customer relationship management programs, bookkeeping software, employee management software, or project management software
Customers and client have separate Portal to Access the website.
If employees want to do work from home, they can securely access files and folders wherever they are, but here we are using both network server cloud services in the company.


<h4 id="Com">* Communication</h4>

Email is an essential tool for communication in every kind of company. If you want to be able to interact efficiently and handle the messages you send and receive from the client and consumers, as well as provide their feedback through email, it is vital that you acquire the appropriate system. In most cases, smaller businesses like ours discover that depending on a separate email service provider affords them greater freedom and minimises the administrative costs associated with administration.


<h4 id="Security">* IT Security</h4>

IT data is priceless. Malware, hacking, and accidents, such as hardware failure or human mistake, may result in data loss, which is why our organisation employs IT security.
The company Restrict employees and client access to our systems by insisting every user has strong passwords to protect the Data.
Control access levels varies from employees and ensure people can only view and edit data they need for their roles.
Our IT Security Use encryption to protect data that is stored on our database, laptops and desktop devices or is being transmitted wirelessly or over the internet, use firewalls to protect your systems from online attacks, hardware firewall at the point where our network joins the internet (this may be built into our router) and a software firewall on each individual computer.

<h2 id="Justification">Justification for each final recommendation provided:</h2>

**Cost**

*On Premises*: our enterprises that deploy software on premise, they are responsible for the ongoing costs of the server hardware, power consumption, and space.

*Cloud*: Enterprises that elect to use a cloud computing model only need to pay for the resources that they use, with none of the maintenance and upkeep costs, and the price adjusts up or down depending on how much is consumed.

**Control**

*On Premises*: In an on-premises environment, enterprises retain all their data and are fully in control of what happens to it, for better or worse. Companies in highly regulated industries with extra privacy concerns are more likely to hesitate to leap into the cloud before others because of this reason.

*Cloud*: In a cloud computing environment, the question of ownership of data is one that many companies – and vendors for that matter, have struggled with. Data and encryption keys reside within your third-party provider, so if the unexpected happens and there is downtime, you maybe be unable to access that data.

**Security**

*On Premises*: Companies that have extra sensitive information, such as government and banking industries must have a certain level of security and privacy that an on-premises environment provides. Despite the promise of the cloud, security is the primary concern for many industries, so an on-premises environment, despite some of its drawbacks and price tag, make more sense.

*Cloud*: Security concerns remain the number one barrier to cloud computing deployment. There have been many publicized cloud breaches, and IT departments around the world are concerned. From personal information of employees such as login credentials to a loss of intellectual property, the security threats are real.


<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion:</h2>

By using cloud computing solutions for your small business/medium business you add flexibility, security and scalability to your operations. You're also making it easier for everyone to work from anywhere, improving work-life balance and productivity.

The cloud is generally cheaper. Hardware and replacements are costly with on-premises solutions. You pay for all maintenance costs because you own and control the hardware.

Consequently, using the cloud for small businesses will be wise.
